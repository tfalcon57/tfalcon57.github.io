A wall/gate defense game where you play as a gardener that has to protect his garden from being overrun by snakes (Python, get it). This game is wave based, meaning there is no end,  and the player must the garden for as long as possible. A scoring system will keep count of snakes the player defeats. Each wave becomes more challenging as the number of snakes increases, and so does their speed.
